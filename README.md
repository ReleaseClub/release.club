# Release Club

## Getting Started - How to Fork

Ready to grow beyond the UI we provide? Fork it and build the custom experience you need.

> Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/0xTranqui/zora-starter-kit.git
```
> Install dependencies
```
cd release.club
npm install
```
> Run locally
```
npm run dev
```

You now have a version of the the release club website running locally :))

Replace our landing page and branding with your own and build the custom experience you need.

. . . create what is missing . . .
